AVA Task

Develop a running web application
This application will have to manage basic patient data 
(name, surname, date of birth and social security number). 

For each patient should be possible to record one or more visit(s). 
Each visit has to contain the date and time of the visit, 
the type of the visit (either at home or at the doctor office), 

the reason of the visit (first visit, recurring visit, urgent) and 
the family history (a free text section).

The application workflow has to:

• Select a Patient
• create or update a visit for the patient
• update a visit
• View all Patients
• View all Visits of a particular patient
• all data have to be persisted

Main focus is on:
• communication
• the way you structure and organize your work
• code quality
• documentation
• tests

Don’t Forget:
• Unit tests
• API driven

Non-functional requirements:

• Use REST APIs
